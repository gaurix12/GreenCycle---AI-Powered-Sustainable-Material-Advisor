# GreenCycle---AI-Powered-Sustainable-Material-Advisor

**Problem Statement**
The traditional linear economy, which relies on taking, making, and disposing of materials, leads to resource depletion and excessive waste. However, there are few intelligent tools that help users accurately identify and sort materials for reuse, upcycling, or recycling. Consequently, manual sorting remains slow and inefficient, limiting progress toward a sustainable circular economy.

**Project Overview**
GreenCycle is an AI + Computer Vision project that leverages deep learning (InceptionResNetV2) to classify waste and material images into complex categories for circular economy actions such as reuse, repair, upcycling, and recycling. The system integrates image classification with a conversational chatbot interface, enabling real-time guidance on material lifecycle pathways and sustainable decision-making.

This project directly supports United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Specifically, it contributes to target 12.5, which aims by 2030 to substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse. By empowering consumers and businesses to accurately classify materials and optimize their reuse or recycling, GreenCycle helps minimize waste sent to landfills, conserves natural resources, reduces pollution, and fosters responsible consumption.

**Technology Stack**
